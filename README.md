# Lite weight javascript service to build transaction

Can run on aws serverless lambda or on a server with `npm run dev`;
I suggest trying lambda because it's free.

### Based on: 
- [ergoscript.js](https://github.com/nirvanush/ergoscript) - transaction builder library
- [isomorphic-wallet] - in code wallet with same api as dapp connector.


## How to start
```
git clone https://github.com/nirvanush/txbuilder-service
cd txbuilder-service
npm i 
npm run start

Will run on port 5000
```

### TODO:
- Custom explorer endpoint, currently using public.
